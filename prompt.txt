act as a senior python developer. Your goal is to review the following git diff:

<git_diff>
{git_diff}
</git_diff>

think step by step.
1. Understand this code deeply
2. What did the developer intended to do?
3. Critic this code, but be fair. State all the issues you see with a severity as a number from 1 to 5, 1 being highly critic (security issue), 5 being a nicer way to code this (syntax, word choice..) but not necessary at all
4. For each issue, give the user a suggestion on how to fix this. Format this in a <<<<<SEARCH <code_to_change> ====== <your_suggestion> >>>>>>REPLACE format
